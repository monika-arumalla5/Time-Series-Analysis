# Time-Series-Analysis

## Research Question: 
Should one buy, sell or hold Tesla stock? - Forecast stock price for the upcoming five days

## Motivation for the project:
Tesla plays a key role in the innovation industry and has undergone huge overall upward trend. This is clearly evident from the fact that the stock which was valued at about $7 in 2013 is currently valued at close to $800. The stock has a high risk value of about $203 during the 2013-2021 period. Additionally, I have been personally following this stock over the last few years and I am keen to perform a time series analysis, understand the stock fluctuation pattern and utilise the time series prediction as a tool during my own stock trading decision making.

## Data and time period considered: 
I propose to use the yahoo finance platform to extract the Tesla stock price data. I plan to consider the January, 2013 – October, 10, 2021 period for my time-series analysis with the data interval of a day.

## Tools utilized: 
For the analysis, I will be mainly utilizing the Statmodels package, Yahoo finance API, Facebook’s Prophet package, Matplotlib and Seaborn visualization packages and python programming language.
